## My process

  First, I made div with container class in which the QR code image and the text below it will be included and then on container I applied flexbox centered content and set the flex direction to column.
  The text align property for the container was justify so the h2 text 
  would be justified.
  
  Then I wrapped the text below h2 in a div with class text-p, and set it's text align property to center.
